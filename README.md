# Hey, I’m Raffael 👋

I build **automation-first platforms** and **edge/web ingress systems** that survive production reality.
Applied security is one arena of the same problem: **systems under pressure, adversarial inputs, and messy constraints**.

- Based in Basel, Switzerland
- Writing: https://raskell.io
- Speaking: RSAC 2026 (details soon)

## What I work on
- Platform automation (workflows, guardrails, self-service, operability)
- Edge systems (reverse proxies, policy, observability, safe change)
- Applied security (signal > noise, pragmatic controls, incident-driven improvements)
- Preference: **open standards and sustainable solutions over vendor lock-in**

## Selected repos
- **Envoy / Proxy-WASM experiments** (filters, modules, getting started)
- **OpenBSD daily-driver** curation and tooling
- **Walnut**: POSIX-friendly knowledge base standard experiments
