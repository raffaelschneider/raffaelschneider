# Hey, I’m Raffael 👋

I build **automation-first platforms** and **edge/web ingress systems** that survive production reality.
Applied security is one arena of the same problem: **systems under pressure, adversarial inputs, and messy constraints**.

- Based in Basel, Switzerland
- Writing: https://raskell.io
- Speaking: RSAC 2026 (details soon)

## What I work on
- Platform automation (workflows, guardrails, self-service, operability)
- Edge systems (reverse proxies, policy, observability, safe change)
- Applied security (signal > noise, pragmatic controls, incident-driven improvements)
- Preference: **open standards and sustainable solutions over vendor lock-in**

## Selected projects
- [**Sentinel**](https://sentinel.raskell.io/): Security-first reverse proxybuilt to guard the free web
- [**Learn You The Web**](https://learn-you-the-web.raskell.io/): A e-book about how the web works, explained in simple words.
